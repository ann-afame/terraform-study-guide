## Objective 6: Navigate Terraform workflow

<details><summary>Describe Terraform workflow ( Write -> Plan -> Create )</summary>
<p>

- Write 
  - Author infrastructure as code 
- Plan 
  - Preview changes before applying
- Create (Apply)
  - Provision reproducible infrastructure 
- Configuration is written like any program, use version control to keep track of changes 
    ```BASH 
        # Create repository
        $ git init my-infra && cd my-infra
        Initialized empty Git repository in /.../my-infra/.git/
        # Write initial config
        $ vim main.tf
        # Initialize Terraform
        $ terraform init
        Initializing provider plugins...
        # ...
        Terraform has been successfully initialized!
    ```
- running ```Terraform plan``` repeatedly is useful to make sure there are no syntax errors and the correct code is being written per the desired outcome.
-  First run ```Terraform apply``` before pushing to git to make sure the provisions are correct 
-  While working in teams it is best to use branches to avoid code collision. 
   ```BASH
   $ git checkout -b <branch-name>
    Switched to a new branch <branch-name>
   ``` 
- Teams can review changes via Terraform plans and pull requests
