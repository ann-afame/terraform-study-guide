## Infrastructure as a Code 

#### Objective 1: Understand Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts

<details><summary>Explain What IaC is?</summary>
<p>

Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your data center to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.

IaC makes it easy to provision and apply infrastructure configurations, saving time. It standardizes workflows across different infrastructure providers (e.g., VMware, AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) by using a common syntax across all of them.
